# The file SigprocActionLabels_sp.properties is the shared "Action" resource 
# bundle for all Spanish-speaking locales. It overrides most, if not all, of 
# the resources in the default bundle, and in turn may be overridden by
# country-specific variants (not yet implemented).
#
# Note that action accelerators are currently universal vs. locale-specific.
